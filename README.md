# An Anlysis of Kickstarter Campaigns - Module 1

# **Overview**  

  This is a look at a dataset from past kickstarter campaigns to determine if there are any insights to be gleamed and hopefully predict some things that could be done on a future kickstarter campaign to make it successful.  This dataset was sent to us by a client looking to do their own kickstarter campaign for a play.  We were given a raw dataset that needed some cleaning up and breaking down before proper analysis could be done to really focus on the specific type/category of kickstarter campaign that the client needed.  Upon filtering and visualizing the data, some insights were gained, either with a graph or statistical calculations, that we could then forward to the client.  
  
# **Analysis and Challenges** 

  **Category Breakdown**

   After getting the dataset cleaned up and ensuring all data was readable, certain analysis was done on the data.  First and foremost, we focused data that was in the US since the client said that is where the play would be.  Next we moved to create some visuals to better understand that data.  First one being was the "Theater" category even successul at all.

  According to the graph, the theater category is the most successful out of all the others.  In fact, out of all the total theater kickstarter campaigns, 912, there were 525 successful.  
  
  **Subcategory Breakdown**
  
  We can break this down even further since our client more specifically wants to fund a play, which is a subcategory of theater.

  This shows us that number of successful play kickstarters is definitely more than half.  This tells us that there is a good chance this clients kickstarter campaign for her play can be influenced to succeed as long as proper steps are taken.  But in order to find out what those steps need to be, we must do more analysis.  
  
  **Launch Dates effect on Outcome**
  
  One key factor in any launch of a product/idea is timing.  When would be the best time to launch a kickstarter campaign and when would be the worst?  After filtering the data to show us the "Theater" category, we could then break it down into the months to see which months had the most success and which had the most failed.

  This graph shows us that the months with the most successful theater campaigns are May, June, and July in that order.  The months with the least are January, March, September, November, and December.  Also, the month with the most failed campaigns is October.  This seems to follow a trend of people not spending much money during the winter holidays and spending more money during the middle of spring and/or start of summer.  
  
**Goal Amounts effect on Outcome**

  One of the last graphs made was to look at the relationship between the stated goal amount, or the amount the kickstarter campaign asked for, to how well they were funded.  Were the campaigns who asked for the most successful or unsuccessful?  What abou the least?  After filtering the data to only look at the "plays" subcategory of "theater",  the data was then broken up into Goal amounts seperated in 5,000 dollar increments.

  This last graph tells the client that as long as she asks below a certain amount of capital, around 4,000 dollars, she has roughly a 70% chance to be fully funded.  
  
**Challenges**

   There weren't any particular challenges that stand out from the typical in this project.  One challenge that most could encounter would be not understanding what the statistical methods are telling them.  
https://github.com/wprich/KickStarter-AnalysisM1/blob/main/Resources/Descriptive%20Statistics.png
![Descriptive Statistics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85487722/124501158-e94d4700-dd75-11eb-9b2d-4539c4f202c0.png)

  These calculations show us the statistics based on US Kickstarters only.  It tells us that mean for the goal and the mean for the pledged seem to be close together.  Same for the median of the goal and median of the pledged.  While the standard deviation seems to be high for either category, pledged and goal, it seems that if our client can keep the goal at or below 3,000 dollars, they stand a good chance at being funded.  If the cost or goal goes to 5,000 or higher, the chances of being funded decreases significantly.

# **Results and Limitations**

**Conclusions**
  
  One conclusion that can clearly be drawn from the "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" chart, is that the most successful month for a kickstarter campaign of the category is May.  So our client should plan to launch their kickstarter around that time.  Another conclusion is that the client should also avoid pushing the kickstarter until October as that is the worst month and has the greatest number of failed kickstarters.  Again, this falls in line with people tend to spend their money and go out more during the mid spring to summertime and save money closer to holidays since they will be shopping for gifts.
